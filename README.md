# Gritkit
A collection of grungy textures I create sporadically from photos, dirt, spills, etc.
Sometimes you'll need subtle dust or a complex grunge pattern, so I thought it would be handy to have an evergrowing pack of textures that not only I can use but everybody else can.

### References
Here are some references of which files you'll encounter in this pack.
