# Gritkit
An evergrowing collection of grungy textures I create sporadically from photos, dirt, spills, etc.
Features raster and vector editions.

### To-do
- [ ] Add visual examples
- [ ] Write some quick tutorials
- [ ] Upload the actual textures

### References
Here are some references of which files you'll encounter in this pack:

### Requisites
* For vector files: Illustrator, Inkscape, etc.
* For PNGs: Photoshop, Gimp, etc.

### Why
Grunge textures are abstract and always differ from one another. Sometimes you'll need subtle dust or a complex kind of grit pattern. So I thought it would be handy to have an evergrowing pack of textures for everybody to use and mix as they please.
