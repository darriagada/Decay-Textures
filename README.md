# Decay Textures
A collection of grungy textures I create sporadically from photos, dirt, spills, etc.

Sometimes you need an specific grungy texture, so I thought it would be handy to have an evergrowing pack of textures that not only me but everybody else can use them.

### Download

### Recommended software
Here's an incomplete list of recommended software but you can use any software you like.
* For vector files: [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [CorelDRAW](http://www.coreldraw.com/), etc.
* For raster images: [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), etc.

### How to use them
**If you are using the raster images:** you can use them as backgrounds or overlay textures. Mix them using **blending modes.** You can attach a Hue/Saturation filter if you want to change the base color or you can invert the colors, etc.

**If you are using the vector textures:** you can grab one or multiple textures and **change it's fill color** since all of them are editable. You have more control over the textures but be aware that this version is **more resource intensive** due to the amount of vector paths generated.

## To-do
- [x] Upload the actual textures
