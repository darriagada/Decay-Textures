# Gritkit
A collection of grungy textures I create sporadically from photos, dirt, spills, etc.

It features raster and vector editions.

### To-do
- [ ] Upload the actual textures
- [ ] Add visual examples
- [ ] Write some quick tutorials


### References
Here are some references of which files you'll encounter in this pack:

### Recommended software
Here's an incomplete list of recommended software but you can use any software you like.
* For vector files: [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [CorelDRAW](http://www.coreldraw.com/), etc.
* For raster images: [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), etc.

### Why
Grunge textures are abstract and always differ from one another. Sometimes you'll need subtle dust or a complex kind of grit pattern. So I thought it would be handy to have an evergrowing pack of textures for everybody to use and mix as they please.
