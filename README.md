# Gritkit
A grit &amp; grime textures pack.

This is an evergrowing collection of vector & raster grungy textures I create sporadically from photos, dirt, spills, etc.

### To-do
* Add visual examples
* Write some quick tutorials
* Upload the actual textures

### References
Here are some references of which files you'll encounter in this pack:

### Requisites
* Using vector files: Illustrator, Inkscape, etc.
* Using PNGs: Photoshop, Gimp, etc.

### Why
Grunge textures are abstract and always differ from one another. Sometimes you'll need subtle dust or a complex kind of grit pattern. So I thought it would be handy to have an evergrowing pack of textures for everybody to use and mix as they please.
