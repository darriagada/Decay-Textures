# Gritkit
A collection of grungy textures I create sporadically from photos, dirt, spills, etc.

Sometimes you'll need subtle dust or a complex grunge pattern, so I thought it would be handy to have an evergrowing pack of textures that not only me but everybody else can use them.

### Download
Feel free to [grab the entire repository](https://github.com/darriagada/Gritkit/archive/master.zip) â€” Current version is **1.0**

### References
Here are some references of which type of textures you'll find in this pack.

### Recommended software
Here's an incomplete list of recommended software but you can use any software you like.
* For vector files: [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), [CorelDRAW](http://www.coreldraw.com/), etc.
* For raster images: [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/), [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), etc.

### How to use them
If you are planning on using the raster images, you can use them as backgrounds or overlay textures. You can blend them using **blending modes.**. You can add Hue/Saturation if you want to change the base color if you need it.

On the other hand, if you are using the vector textures, you can grab one or multiple textures and **change it's fill color** since all of them are editable. Be aware that this version is more resource intensive due to the amount of vector paths generated.

## To-do
- [x] Upload the actual textures
- [x] Add visual examples
